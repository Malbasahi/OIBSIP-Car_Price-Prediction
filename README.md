# OIBSIP-Car_Price-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of cars based on various attributes and features, such as the car's present price, mileage, age, and categorical variables like fuel type and transmission.

# Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: The project begins with the cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset to handle missing values and convert categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning.

Feature Selection: Relevant features are chosen to train the model effectively. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets.

Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining valuable information.

Model Comparison: Several machine learning models are trained, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression. These models are evaluated to determine the best-performing one.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The selected model is fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques to maximize predictive accuracy.

Prediction and Comparison: The model's performance is assessed by making predictions on real car data and new, randomly generated data. Predictions are compared with actual selling prices to evaluate accuracy.
